Shall I compare thee to a [33msummer[0m's day?
Thou art more [31mlovely[0m and more [32mtemperate[0m:
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And [34msummer[0m's lease hath all too short a date;
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his [35mgold[0m complexion dimm'd;
And every [36mfair[0m from fair sometime declines,
By chance or nature's changing course untrimm'd;
But thy [31meternal[0m summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st;
Nor shall Death brag thou wander'st in his shade,
When in eternal lines to time thou grow'st:
    So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,
    So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
